# Rhyming Game Project Proposal


My Rhyming Game project will have two or more modes. The first mode is a simple phonetic dictionary where you can look up words and it will give you other words that it rhymes with. The second mode is the rhyming game.
The user can pick a difficulty, Easy , Medium, Or hard. Next the game will give them a time limit, let's say 60 seconds for now. The player will have that much time to get as many rhymes as possible. If they get a rhyme the game will go onto the next word and will repeat until time is over. Based on the complexity of the rhyme (measured off number of syllables and other factors) the game will reward a number of points per word and will give a user their score at the end of the round. The application will track personal best per each account, and there will be a global leaderboard.
Users will have to make accounts to play the game. There will also be a system of sending other users friend requests and seeing their past scores and records. There will possibly be a system for challenging other players to a match.

I will be using the https://www.datamuse.com/api/ for rhyming data and have already got permission from the creators

The Tech stack on plan on using is React for the frontend and Node/Express for the backend
The focus will be evenly on backend and frontend as I want to put extra effort into the design and feel of the application as that's where I usually fall short,I also want it to be fully responsive to it'll look and feel good on mobile, and I also want a fully functional database driven backend.

The target demographic for this Website is anyone who wants to either play a rhyming game with their friends, or get better at rhyming for whatever reason.

DataBase
The database schema will have two tables
User: will store all user information as well as their highscore
User_friends: Will store all friends data and friend requests
